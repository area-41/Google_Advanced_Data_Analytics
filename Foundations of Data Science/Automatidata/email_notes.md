## Email Notes

Subject: Review meeting notes

If you are able to read this, then your company accounts have been created! Now is the perfect time to get started. Last week, I attended an internal meeting with our leadership team about a new project we are about to begin. You’ll receive more information in the next few days, but I would like you to be aware of some needs that were identified by our leadership team. Here is an excerpt from the notes I took during the Automatidata leadership team meeting. I’ve organized the points by the person who made them.

#### Uli King  (Senior Project Manager)

- The data team will need a global-level project document to outline the goals and milestones.
- I am working closely with Titus Nelson over at the New York City Taxi and Limo Commission. He has requested some visuals to share with TLC’s executives.

#### Luana Rodriquez (Senior Data Analyst)

- The dataset from TLC has to be inspected before any analysis can begin. 
- Our team needs to determine what information the TLC data provides through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Eventually, our team will need to test to find if the model is delivering consistent results.

#### Udo Bankole (Director of Data Analysis)

- Before we present any insights to TLC, we'll need to determine whether or not the model we produce meets the project requirements.
- Once we have a final model, I'll need to know the main talking points going into our presentation with TLC.

My thoughts and concerns…

- I think it's best to use Python for the TLC project. I'll have someone on my team set that up as soon as we have the plan in place.
- It will be important to establish the relationship between any variables within the TLC data. I'd suggest the data team consider A/B testing, since that will analyze the relationship between the two most useful variables and subsequently provide data-driven support for future business decisions.

Review the meeting notes above to become familiar with the project’s context. I’ll ask you to identify project tasks and come up with a structure to guide the data team through this project. After our discussion about your experience in the certificate program offered by Google, I know that your efficient communication style and problem-solving will enhance the abilities of the data team. 

There will be more details sent to you very soon.

Welcome to the team,

Deshawn Washington

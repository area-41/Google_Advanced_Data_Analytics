#### Project goal:  
In this fictional scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride.

#### Background: 
Since 1971, TLC has been regulating and overseeing the licensing of New York City's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.

#### Scenario:
You are a newly-hired data professional at Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm. Automatidata’s focus is to help clients transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions. In this scenario, you will consult with The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission to develop an app that will help users (TLC riders) estimate their taxi fares before their ride. Your first responsibility as a data analytics consultant will be to structure the necessary tasks into a project proposal that establishes milestones for the ride fare data project. 

#### Tasks:
- Gather information from the notes from the last executive meeting of Automatidata
- Assign PACE stages to the requested tasks
- Organize tasks into milestones
- Create a project proposal for the executive team’s approval


Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

Note: This project's dataset was created for pedagogical purposes and may not be indicative of New York City taxi cab riders' behavior. The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this project are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased) is intended or should be inferred. And, the data shared in this project has been created for pedagogical purposes only.

Automatidata is in the earliest stages of the TLC project. The following tasks are needed before the team can begin the data analysis process:

A project proposal identifying the following:

- Organize project tasks into milestones
- Classify tasks using the PACE workflow
- Identify relevant stakeholders

#### Assignment
For the first assignment, Automatidata will need a project proposal that will create milestones for the tasks within the TLC project. Remember to take into account your audience, team, project goal, and PACE stages of each task in planning your project deliverable.
